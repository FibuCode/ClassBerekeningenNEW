#Aerolic & Hydro calculations


**This is a practice project that you can use to calculate volume flow values**

**Use this console program to calculate:**

1. volume based on diameter and speed
2. volume based on dimensions and speed
3. new volume derived from an increase/decrease in aerolic pressure(Pa) that corresponds with a measured volume

It is possible this list will be extended with more calculations in the future.
